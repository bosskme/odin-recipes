Project Introduction: Odin Recipes

The Odin Recipes project is an introductory web development assignment focused on building a simple recipe website using HTML. The project is structured in several iterations, each adding more complexity and features. Starting with a basic homepage, you gradually create individual recipe pages, incorporate navigation links, and enhance each recipe with images, descriptions, ingredient lists, and step-by-step instructions.

Skills Demonstrated and Learned
By completing this project, you will have demonstrated and developed the following skills:

HTML Structure and Boilerplate: Creating multiple HTML files with correct boilerplate code and semantic structure.

Directory Organization: Structuring files and folders logically (e.g., separating recipes into their own directory).

Navigation and Linking: Building internal links between pages, enabling smooth navigation throughout the website.

Content Formatting: Using headings, paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists to organize content clearly and accessibly.

Image Integration: Adding images to web pages to enhance visual appeal and context.

Attention to Detail: Ensuring consistency in page structure and navigation across multiple recipe pages.

Self-Reflection
Completing the Odin Recipes project provided hands-on experience with the foundational elements of web development. I learned how to organize a multi-page website, create clear navigation paths, and present information in a user-friendly way. This project reinforced my understanding of HTML tags and file management, setting a solid base for more advanced web development topics in the future.
